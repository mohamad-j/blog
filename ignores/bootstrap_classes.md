# Bootstrap Classes

Here are some of the most commonly used Bootstrap classes and their purposes:

## Container Classes

`.container` and `.container-fluid` are used to center and horizontally pad your site's contents. `.container` provides a responsive fixed width container, while `.container-fluid` is a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

Example:
```html
<div class="container">
  <!-- content here -->
</div>
